## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a well management system app that is able to interact with the REST API to allow users to either create, delete, update or view well details. The users also have the ability to view the well history of a specific if needed.

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


#### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

* **JSX** - JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It converts HTML tags into react elements. It is an extension of JavaScript based on ES6, that is translated into regular JavaScript at runtime. JSX was used to write all HTML elements in React (within Javascript code) in this project.
* **CSS** - CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. An external App.css style sheet was created to style the pages of the web page. For this project both inline and external stylesheets were used.
* **React** - React is an open source javascript library that is used to build interactive user interfaces. React was used for this project because of its simplicity, performance and also very extensive
* **React Bootstrap** - Another stylesheet used was react boostrap which is built with both react and bootstrap. This was used for styling of some call to actions and elements
* **Axios** - Axios is a library that helps us to make http requests to external resources. For this project, there was a need to retrieve data from an external API so that it can be displayed in the web pages. Axios was able to handle all the requests and responses. The reason why axios was used is because it supports older browsers which makes this app functional accross different versions. Also because it is based on the Promise API, it has some advantages, such as protection against cross-site request forgery (CSFR) amongst others.
* **Heroku** - Heroku is used to deploy, manage and scale your application. Heroku was used for the deployment of the well management app. Heroku was used because it is straightforward to use and also provides a pre-installed operating system and servers thereby eliminating the need to configure the infrastructure.

## Backend
The backend of this project is hosted on Azure. The backend wasn't designed by me but a Swagger framework (_Swagger is an Interface Description Language for describing RESTful APIs expressed using JSON_) was provided to give an insight to the information that is required to be consumed by the API and their respective end points
